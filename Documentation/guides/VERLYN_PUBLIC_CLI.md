# Verlyn Public CLI Guide

This guide explains the installed public `verlyn` CLI used by contributors and
assistants inside a governed repository. It documents the product workflow only:
do not use private Verlyn developer commands, direct database access, or shell
provider tools as substitutes for these commands.

## Context Resolution

Most commands resolve the current user, server, project, and repository from
saved CLI login state plus the current checkout. In normal daily work, after you
are logged in and working inside a known repo, you should not need to pass
`--profile`, `--server`, `--repo-slug`, or `--target`.

Use optional context arguments only when you are bootstrapping or overriding
context deliberately:

| Argument | Meaning | Normal use |
|---|---|---|
| `--server` | Verlyn API base URL for `verlyn auth login`; omitted login reuses saved server state when available. | First login, changing servers, or repairing a bad saved server. |
| `--username` | Username for `verlyn auth login`; omitted login prompts for it. | Automation or when avoiding an interactive username prompt. |
| `--profile` | Saved CLI auth profile override. | Diagnostics or automation; avoid for normal repo work. |
| `--repo-slug` | Repository identity override when the current checkout cannot determine the repo. | Diagnostics, automation, or working outside a saved checkout. |
| `--target` | Local checkout path override on commands that expose it. | Diagnostics or explicit checkout selection; not normal workflow. |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output. | Agents, scripts, and tests. Humans can omit it for readable output. |

If a command cannot resolve the repo without an override, treat that as a
target/login/binding issue to repair, not as a reason to hard-code overrides in
normal workflow.

## Startup Commands

Use these at the beginning of an assistant session:

```bash
verlyn auth status
verlyn workflow assistant-startup --json
verlyn workflow assert-edit-route --json
verlyn target show --json
verlyn changes list
```

- `auth status` confirms the saved session, user, API server, expiry, and idle
  state.
- `workflow assistant-startup --json` returns the current repo state, visible
  workflow state, and recommended next action after context compaction or a new
  session.
- `workflow assert-edit-route --json` fails closed when the current checkout is
  not authorized for edits or no active route exists.
- `target show --json` confirms which repo this checkout is bound to.
- `changes list` shows your working changes by default.

For diagnostics across visible owners and statuses:

```bash
verlyn changes list --owner-scope all --status-scope all
```

Do not use undocumented shortcuts for all-scope diagnostics.

## Change Workflow

Common change commands:

```bash
verlyn changes create --title "..." --change-type <type> --effort-band <small|medium|large>
verlyn changes show <change-id>
verlyn changes update <change-id> --proposal-summary "..." --proposal-scope "..."
verlyn changes activate <change-id>
verlyn changes refresh-branch <change-id>
verlyn changes next
```

- `changes create` creates a draft change. `--change-type` and
  `--effort-band` are required so the change can be categorized and planned.
- `changes show` reads the current durable change record.
- `changes update` changes metadata such as proposal sections, acceptance
  criteria, priority, dependencies, and owner.
- `changes activate` starts implementation and binds or creates the governed
  work branch. Do this before editing code for a change.
- `changes refresh-branch` repairs or refreshes the bound local work branch.
- `changes next` asks Verlyn for the next unblocked change in the current chain.

Work-item commands use JSON arrays so one call can update one or many items:

```bash
verlyn work-items list <change-id>
verlyn work-items update <change-id> --creates-json '[{"title":"Add validation"}]'
verlyn work-items update <change-id> --updates-json '[{"task_id":"<work-item-id>","status":"done"}]'
```

Use `--creates-json` for new work items and `--updates-json` for changes to
existing work items. Each item in the JSON array is one work-item mutation.

## Delivery Versus Deployment

Use the command that matches the outcome you want:

| Command | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `verlyn changes deliver <change-id>` | Source-control closeout only. It commits local dirty work when `--commit-message` is supplied, pushes with Verlyn-managed provider credentials, opens or updates the pull request, merges it, records closeout, and returns the local checkout to the base branch when safe. It does not deploy. |
| `verlyn changes deploy <change-id>` | Runs the same source-control closeout path as `deliver`, then triggers or monitors the configured deployment provider and records deployment evidence. |

In human-readable mode, `deliver` and `deploy` print lightweight phase progress
while long hosted operations run, such as PR package preparation, delivery gate
checking, source-control closeout, deployment handoff, provider wait, and
transient deployment recovery. `--json` output remains machine-readable and
does not include progress chatter.

Examples:

```bash
verlyn changes deliver <change-id> --merge-method squash
verlyn changes deploy <change-id> --merge-method squash
```

Delivery options:

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--commit-message` | Commit dirty local changes before hosted delivery. Use it when the local worktree has the intended implementation changes. |
| `--merge-method` | Provider merge strategy: `merge`, `squash`, or `rebase`. The common default in Verlyn workflows is squash. |
| `--keep-remote-branch` | Do not delete the remote work branch after merge. Use only when you intentionally need to preserve it. |
| `--keep-local-branch` | Do not delete the local work branch after merge. The CLI still tries to return to the base branch when safe. |

Deployment-only options:

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--source-ref` | Deploy an already delivered source ref instead of running delivery first. Omit it for normal deliver-and-deploy. |
| `--commit-sha` | Expected commit for an already delivered source ref. Use with `--source-ref` when you need commit verification. |

If a change explicitly has no governed work branch, `deliver` performs a
no-code closeout. It closes the workflow item without opening a pull request
because no source branch exists to merge.

## Repositories

Use Verlyn to clone repos so the checkout, auth profile, provider credentials,
and repo binding are aligned:

```bash
verlyn repos clone
verlyn repos clone <repo-slug> ./local-folder --project-id <project-id>
```

- Omit `repo_slug` to use interactive project/repo selection when available.
- `destination` defaults to the repository name.
- `--project-id` selects the project binding used for provider credential
  resolution.
- `--branch` selects a branch to clone; omitted clone uses the repository
  default branch.
- `--no-save-checkout` prevents the clone from becoming the saved local checkout
  mapping.

## Reviews And Gates

Use review and gate commands to keep evidence in Verlyn:

```bash
verlyn workflow gate <change-id> --scope delivery
verlyn reviews record <change-id> --tier 1 --reviewer <name> --disposition accepted --summary "Reviewed."
```

- `workflow gate` inspects whether a change is ready for a named scope such as
  delivery.
- `reviews record` writes review evidence to the durable Verlyn workflow record.

When a command fails because the current user cannot see a repo, project, or
change, treat that as a scope or authorization issue. Do not switch to private
developer commands or direct provider tools to bypass Verlyn.
